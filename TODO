# Add SageUpload model to parse and store uploaded xml - with generator
# Add a SageController generator - should test for presence of Upload and Download models and only include relevant parts
# Flesh out parsing code for SageImport - how it pulls out relevant orders/customers and saves the association
# Add metacode methods to ActiveRecord with option to supply custom field 
## sage_invoice class method
## sage_sales_order class method
## sage_customer class method
# Write readme file explaining how to use all this
# Upload to GitHub
# Figure someway of handling testing
# Make InvalidFormatErrors give more useful info about whats missing from the map
# Figure way of controlling ordering of XML fields in download - not sure if Connect still cares, think it used to be a problem
